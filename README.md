# A paper on Demographic Species Distribution Models

This repository contains the source code for a paper on Demographic Species Distribution Models - statistical models of species distributions that explicitly consider spatial variation in vital rates (like survival and fecundity) and population dynamics.

It's very much a work in progress.
